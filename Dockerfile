# Install Playwright's Chromium browser binary and its OS-level dependencies for E2E
# testing (see playwright.config.ts / e2e/). Only chromium is installed since this is a
# personal study project (see playwright.config.ts, which only defines a chromium
# project). This must run as the 'node' user (the devcontainer's remoteUser) so the
# browser lands in node's cache dir (~/.cache/ms-playwright) where `npx playwright test`
# looks for it at runtime; '--with-deps' uses the passwordless sudo configured above to
# apt-get install the required shared libraries (fonts, libnss3, etc.).
