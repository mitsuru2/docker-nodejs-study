#!/bin/bash
# scripts/start-work-branch.sh
#
# Create (or resume) the dedicated working branch for the current task, per
# CLAUDE.md's "Working Branch & Pull Requests" rule: work is never committed
# directly to the base branch.
#
# The branch name is computed mechanically as:
#
#   <type>/<issue-number>/claude-code
#
# where:
#   - <issue-number> is "issue-<n>" when this work is tied to GitHub Issue
#     <n>, otherwise today's date as "yyyy-MM-dd".
#   - <type> is "feat" if the issue has the "enhancement" label, "fix" if it
#     has the "bug" label (checked in that priority order); otherwise it
#     falls back to the caller-supplied <feat|fix> argument.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/start-work-branch.sh <issue-number|none> <feat|fix> [<base-branch>]
#
# <feat|fix> is required even when an issue number is given: it's only used
# as a fallback if the issue has neither the "enhancement" nor "bug" label,
# but a valid value must still be supplied up front.
#
# <base-branch> defaults to "main". The new branch is always created from the
# latest origin/<base-branch> (origin is fetched first). If the computed
# branch name already exists locally, it is reused as-is (checked out, not
# recreated) so a session can resume earlier work on the same branch.
